README

The Terrari-Saves repository is for the storage and sharing of characters and worlds across multiple platforms and users. It should make it much easier to synch characters and worlds across all your little computers, even allowing multiple people to play a single character. Im not sure how worlds will be affected by having multiple users committing "updates" to the same branch, though. 

It is intended that each collaborator has their own branch for their own use. It will also be feasible for multiple people to play their own versions of a single character or world.

the save files are in c:/../My\ Documents/My\ Games/Terraria/Player for the player save files, and c:/../My\Documents/My\ Games/World for the world files. Player files are "Player#.plr" file (where the # is a number). Worlds are suffixed with ".wld". 

Its fine to play other people's characters, but please obtain permission before pushing your commits to origin.
